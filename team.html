                        <p>Our team took on the task of bringing TEDx to the University of Auckland to
                            initiate dialogue on issues that affect our community. We believe that 
                            revolutionary ideas have the power to shape our minds by challenging existing notions. 
                            But often these ideas go unheard, because they lack a platform that gives them a voice; 
                            we want TEDxUoA to be that platform.

                                    As part of the TEDx sponsorship team, I aim to make TEDx more accessible to students 
                                    at The University of Auckland and do my part to make TEDx a more engaging and meaningful event!</p>

                                <p>Hi I’m Daniel! I’m studying a BCOM/BSc majoring in Economics, Finance & 
                                    Statistics. I also enjoy cricket, investing and playing the drums/piano. 
                                    I joined TEDxUoA because I’m passionate about challenging our assumptions and 
                                    developing as a society through the sharing of important ideas.

                                    be appreciated by millions of people around the world, which is why I'm 
                                    excited to bring TEDx and an amazing line-up of speakers to the University!</p>

                                    I joined TedxUOA because I never got the chance to join a Tedx program back 
                                    home in Malaysia and thought it’d be a good time to do it now in Auckland. I also 
                                    think Ted talks are a great way to broaden your knowledge on things so why not try 
                                    to be a part of it, right?</p>
